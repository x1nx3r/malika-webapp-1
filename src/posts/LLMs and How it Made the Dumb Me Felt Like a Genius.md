## Where Does It All Start to Go Down
Lately, with the convenience of LLM in my humble daily life as a student studying Computer Science in some backwater university in Indonesia. I have met with the very idea of not having to lift a single finger to complete an assignment by relying on LLM, namely, the all-time popular, everyone's favorite, and infamous ChatGPT.  It was released in November 22t, 2022, and gain traction quickly, with Indonesia being no exception.

I still recall the first time I used it I felt like having a personal holy grail to solve all kinds of my college assignments without having to think twice about it. Being a freshman, most of my subjects are fundamentals--arguably so easy that I didn't need AI's help to learn them.  But knowing how easy they 'hypothetically' should be made me think, *"Uh, these are some real easy-peasy thingies. I'll just breeze through them with my personal 'holy grail' for now. I'll manage some time to study it later when I need it."*  Little did I know that in the future this would come back bite me in the ass, and the future is now, and my ass hurts so bad.

## "Eh.. Easy, I'll Just Had to Do it This Way, Do that That Way, and--Wait.. What The Fuck?"
It was a Tuesday morning, I attended the first session of my Data Structures class in my second semester. Being the clueless, overconfident fuck that I was, I just slept through the whole lecture and didn't pay any single attention. *"Eh, I'll just learn this with ChatGPT later in the afternoon,"* I thought. Well, unsurprisingly, I didn't manage to do that. And just like that, my tuesday routine for the entire semester is set in stone. How did it go, You ask? What? Linked Lists? What are those? Wait--lemme ask ChatGPT about that real quick.
